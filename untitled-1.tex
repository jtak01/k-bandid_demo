\section{Goal}
The goal of this assignment is to explore the inadequacies of the sample average method in non-stationary problems. Additionally, multiple feedback techniques will be used (ie, e-greedy, greedy, optimistic initial value, and Upper bound selection) on both stationary and non-stationary settings in order to illuminate the differences between the feedback techniques.
